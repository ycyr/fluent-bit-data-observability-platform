#  Fluent Bit - Data Observability Platform

![ Show image of grafana dashboard using supported Prometheus metric types](https://github.com/ycyr/fluent-bit-data-observability-platform/blob/master/out-prometheus-metrics-dashboard.png "Demo grafana dashboard showing supported Prometheus metric types")


## Purpose
This project provides a full data observability platform made up of a combination 
of several flagship CNCF log and metrics projects in the form of a single 
docker-compose environment.  
* Grafana - Data visualization UI
* Grafana Loki - Log aggregation system
* Prometheus Metrics - Systems and service monitoring system
* Fluent Bit - Data ingestion endpoint

This is a miniature version of a much larger cluster 
of containers we have hosted in the cloud.  

## What is it used for?
* Testing, experimentation, and 
debugging configurations prior to deploying into production
* A learning tool for getting up to speed on how the larger environment works 
* Grafana dashboard development sandbox environment
* Develop and test custom Fluent Bit configurations

**Reference Talk:** 
* [FluentCon 2021: Fluent Bit - Swiss Army Tool of Observability Data Ingestion](https://sched.co/iKok)
* [Fluent Bit Prometheus Metrics Output Plugin](https://github.com/neiman-marcus/fluent-bit-out-prometheus-metrics)
  * Note: fluent-bit-out-prometheus-metrics contains subset of the docker-compose environment found in this project.  If you were to run both, there would be port conflicts with the pushgateway container.

My hope is that the wider community will find this equally useful.

I plan to add a component to make it easy to switch between configuration sets and to start an archive of configurations in this project.

## Using the demo environment
#### Requirements:
* Either Docker Desktop, or docker and docker-compose.
* Make
* Curl

#### Note:
* Initial build time could be approximately 10-20min. Subsequent builds leverage cached local containers.
### Quick start
```
make all
```

### Build instructions
```
make build
```

### Start platform
```
make start
```

### Show current metrics
Execute repeatedly to see the metrics generated using the plugin.
```
make show-metrics
```

### Show current logs
Execute repeatedly to see the latest container logs
```
make logs
```

### Stop platform
Shutdown demo environment.
```
make stop
```

### Persistent Storage
The docker-compose.yml file is configured for persistent storage.
To disable this, consider using docker-compose-ephemeral.yml.  Copy the desired version to docker-compose.yml and re-run: 
```
make build
```

### Full restart
For occasions when changes don't seem to be taking effect.
```
make full-restart
```

### Local Web Access
Grafana
* http://localhost:3000/
  
Dashboards:
  
* Fluent Bit Prometheus Metrics Plugin
  * Dashboard pictured at the top of this page.  Let it run for 30-60min it will auto-populate using data 
    being sent by the nlog container.
* Data Observability Dashboard
  * Text panel with frequently accessed links

Prometheus Expression Browser
* http://localhost:9090/graph

PushGateway
* http://localhost:9091/
